<p class=MsoNormal><b>Project Summary</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Partners In Business collects information from registrants
for each of its 5 annual conferences. Currently this information is stored in a
database, which is complicated to access and does not allow for information to
be easily searched. In addition to storing the information Partners employees
would like to be able to run various reports on the database. Partners In
Business also has a unique aspect of its business in what it calls
“partnerships” which are essentially prepaid attendance days to any conference,
purchased at a reduced rate. These partnerships are currently managed manually
by reviewing the attendance of each conference and deducting the days from the
partnership. This process is tedious, time consuming and opens the possibility
to errors in accounting for them. The business would like to have a more
automated way of tracking these partnerships in a database.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Project Deliverables</b></p>

also select the number of days they would like to purchase a partnership for
and whether they would like to purchase now or be sent an invoice. This
information will be captured into the database when the user clicks the submit
button. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Transaction</i>: Running various reports of the
information in the database.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Use Case</i>: User will enter information into a
dashboard such as attendee name, company, and conference. The user will then
click a submit button. The information will be used to query the database and
return the result of the query on the users screen.</p>
